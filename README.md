## What is HTML CSS and JavaScript for?

HTML defines the structure of your content, CSS determines the style and layout, and JavaScript makes the content interactive; therefore, it makes the most sense to learn them in that order.

## What it contains

Every sub project contains the following files:

- index.html: the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the website
- style.css: the CSS file that applies the style and layout of the website
- script.js: the JS file that adds the functionality and interactivity of the website
